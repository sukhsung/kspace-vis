# Experimental Processing
Only a few scripts are actually needed for typical diffraction tilt data processing. The workflows in the processing_* files present a typical fitting-plotting with kinematic model pattern. processing_20180115_MoS2_DiffTilt.m	provides the strongest examples/the most workable dataset.
