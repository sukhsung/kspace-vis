# Experimental Processing
## Workflow
Only a few scripts are actually needed for typical diffraction tilt data processing. The workflows in the processing_* files present a typical fitting-plotting with kinematic model pattern. processing_20180115_MoS2_DiffTilt.m	provides the strongest examples/the most workable dataset. 
## Data
Data can be found on Synology, at hlab_vol1/Noah/data/[dataset handle]. .mat files with prefit parameters are included on synology where complete.
